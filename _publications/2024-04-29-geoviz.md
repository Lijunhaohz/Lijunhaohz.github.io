In this paper, we propose a multi-view visualization technology for spatio-temporal knowledge graph(STKG), which utilizes three distinct perspectives: knowledge tree, knowledge net, and knowledge map, to facilitate a comprehensive analysis of the STKG. The knowledge tree enables the visualization of hierarchical interrelation within the STKG, while the knowledge net elucidates semantic relationships among knowledge entities. Additionally, the knowledge map displays spatial and temporal distributions via spatial maps and time axes, respectively. Our visualization technology addresses the limitations inherent in single-view approaches and the deficiency of interaction in spatio-temporal perspectives evident in existing visualization methods. Moreover, we have encapsulated this technology within an integrated, open-source platform named GeoViz. A demo video of GeoViz can be accessed at ![here](https://github.com/JeremyChou28/GeoViz).
